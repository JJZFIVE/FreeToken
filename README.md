# Free Token

***About:*** Free Token was my entry into the world of Web3 software development. The idea is laughably simple: every 24 hours, a wallet is 
allowed to receive a certain amount of Free Tokens until the supply is depleted. Critics say it's the next Dogecoin. If a wallet claimed Free Token less than 24 hours ago, the transaction will revert. Free Token is deployed on the Polygon Mainnet blockchain because it runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) at a fraction of the gas fees (1 transaction is pennies).


I was recovering from my second sinus surgery of 2021 in the winter, and I'd been infatuated with blockchain technology for over a year at that point, so 
I decided that was a great time to dive into Web3 dev. To build this project, I used multiple new technologies: Solidity, NextJS, ethers.js, Hardhat, and Infura.


## Technologies Used

### Frontend (JS)
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- ethers.js (frontend connection npm package to smart contract)


### Backend (Solidity)
- Solidity (smart contract programming language)
- Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- Hardhat (Ethereum development environment)
- Infura (HTTP connection to Polygon blockchain)
